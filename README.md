# Nexus-Conceptual-Model
 This is a basic implementation of the Nexus Conceptual Model as entailed in Virk et al., (2024) _(in prep)_. The key python dependencies are "Pandas","Numpy" and "Matplotlib". For some cells "Rasterio" and "Geopandas" is used. Finally, some cells are connceted with Earth Engine API and can be used to download data directly form google earth engine  using "ee" and "geemap" and process it for further use. Run all cells for Bio_scape, Water_scape, Energy_scape and Social Network Analysis (SNA) notebooks and collect relevant outputs from the output folders. Last cell block in each notebook can be used to visualize and save outputs in the results folder. Run all cells of the Results notebook to visualize spatio-temporally varied results for each scape.
